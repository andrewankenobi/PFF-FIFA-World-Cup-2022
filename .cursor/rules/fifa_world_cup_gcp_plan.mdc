# FIFA World Cup 2022 GCP Project Plan

This document outlines the steps to ingest, analyze, model, and build applications on top of the FIFA World Cup 2022 dataset using Google Cloud Platform services, with a focus on BigQuery, BigQuery ML, Vertex AI Gemini, and Vector Search.

## Phase 1: Setup and Data Ingestion

1.  **GCP Project Setup:**
    *   [ ] Create or select an existing Google Cloud Project.
    *   [ ] Enable necessary APIs:
        *   BigQuery API
        *   Vertex AI API
        *   Cloud Storage API
        *   IAM API
    *   [ ] Configure IAM permissions for users/service accounts.
    *   [ ] Install and configure `gcloud` CLI and `bq` tool.

2.  **Data Acquisition & Preparation:**
    *   [ ] Identify and download the FIFA World Cup 2022 dataset (Specify source, e.g., Kaggle).
    *   [ ] Explore dataset structure (CSV files, JSON, etc.).
    *   [ ] Define BigQuery schemas for each relevant data file.
    *   [ ] (Optional) Pre-process or clean data locally if needed.

3.  **Data Loading into BigQuery:**
    *   [ ] Create a new BigQuery dataset (e.g., `fifa_world_cup_2022`).
    *   [ ] Create tables in the dataset based on defined schemas.
    *   [ ] Upload data files to Google Cloud Storage (GCS).
    *   [ ] Load data from GCS into BigQuery tables using `bq load` or the BigQuery UI.
    *   [ ] Verify data loading completeness and correctness.

## Phase 2: Analytics and Machine Learning

4.  **Basic Analytics (BigQuery SQL):**
    *   [ ] Write exploratory SQL queries:
        *   Top goal scorers.
        *   Match results analysis (wins, losses, draws per team).
        *   Group stage standings.
        *   Player statistics (passes, tackles, saves).
    *   [ ] Create useful Views for recurring analytical patterns.
    *   [ ] (Optional) Connect Looker Studio or other BI tool for visualization.

5.  **BigQuery ML Modeling:**
    *   [ ] Identify potential ML use cases (e.g., predict match winner, classify player roles based on stats).
    *   [ ] Prepare feature data using BigQuery SQL transformations.
    *   [ ] Train simple BQML models (e.g., `LOGISTIC_REG`, `KMEANS`) using `CREATE MODEL`.
    *   [ ] Evaluate model performance using `ML.EVALUATE`.
    *   [ ] Use `ML.PREDICT` for batch predictions.

## Phase 3: Advanced Use Cases and GenAI

6.  **Vector Search Setup (BigQuery):**
    *   [ ] Identify textual or high-dimensional data for embedding (e.g., player bios, team descriptions, match commentary if available).
    *   [ ] Generate embeddings:
        *   Use Vertex AI Embedding API (e.g., `text-embedding-004`) via SQL/Python.
        *   Store embeddings (`ARRAY<FLOAT64>`) in a BigQuery table column.
    *   [ ] Create a Vector Index on the embedding column using `CREATE VECTOR INDEX`. Configure `DISTANCE_TYPE` (e.g., `COSINE`, `EUCLIDEAN`) and `INDEX_TYPE` (e.g., `IVF`).
    *   [ ] Monitor index creation progress.

7.  **Similarity Search Use Case (BigQuery Vector Search):**
    *   [ ] Develop SQL queries using `VECTOR_SEARCH` function.
    *   [ ] Find players similar to a given player based on embedded stats/bio.
    *   [ ] Find matches with similar characteristics or narratives.
    *   [ ] Compare results with/without index (`use_brute_force=true`).
    *   [ ] Evaluate recall and tune index parameters (`fraction_lists_to_search`).

8.  **"Talk to your Data" App (Vertex AI Gemini):**
    *   [ ] Choose a framework for the application (e.g., Streamlit, Flask).
    *   [ ] Set up backend service (e.g., Cloud Functions, Cloud Run).
    *   [ ] Integrate with Vertex AI SDK for Python.
    *   [ ] Design prompts for `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17` to:
        *   Understand natural language questions about the FIFA data.
        *   Generate valid BigQuery SQL queries based on the questions and table schemas.
        *   (Optional) Summarize query results in natural language.
    *   [ ] Implement logic to execute generated SQL against BigQuery and display results.
    *   [ ] Handle potential errors (invalid SQL, query failures).

9.  **Additional Use Cases (Ideation & Potential Implementation):**
    *   [ ] **Fantasy League Points Calculator:** Write SQL UDFs or queries to calculate fantasy points based on player actions (goals, assists, clean sheets, etc.).
    *   [ ] **Player Scouting Tool:** Combine BQML predictions, statistical analysis, and similarity search results to identify players matching specific criteria.
    *   [ ] **Match Narrator:** Use Gemini to generate textual summaries or highlights of matches based on structured event data from BigQuery.

## Phase 4: Documentation and Cleanup

10. **Documentation:**
    *   [ ] Document the schemas, queries, models, and application logic.
    *   [ ] Record findings and insights.
11. **Cleanup:**
    *   [ ] Delete or archive GCS buckets, BigQuery datasets/tables, Vertex AI endpoints, and other resources if no longer needed to manage costs.
